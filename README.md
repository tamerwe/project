# Project Background
TechPlay is an international e-commerce retailer that primarily sells electronic products in a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) environment

The company's data extends from 2019 to early 2021. It includes _sales data_, _marketing data_, _product data_, and _customer data_.
The company has seen a decline of sales in 2021, and along with finding areas of improvement, they want to know whether the cause of this decline can be pinpointed to an internal factor within the 4 data groups, or an external factor that could be adapted to.




The project seeks the root cause of the decline alongside any weaknesses by providing insights in:
+ **Sales Trend Analysis** from 2019 to 2020 to determine historical patterns before the decline to gain more context, particularly focusing on _Revenue, Quantity Sold, and AOV (Average Order Value)_.
+ **Regional Analysis** To evaluate sales and demographics by region
+ **Customer Analysis** To Assess customer base and its impact on sales
+ **Product Analysis** To understand changes in performance and how products compare with each other.

This analysis was encapsulated in two interactive Tableau dashboards: A customer dashboard, and a sales dashboard, which can be found **here**.\
The cleaned Excel file, which contains documentation for the cleaning process, can be found **here**.
